# Retrobat.DS4Windows

This is a 3rd-party implementation designed to help you use DS4Windows with Retrobat's retro games interface.

With this package, you won't need to install DS4Windows to emulate Xbox 360 joysticks or make complex configurations. Just run a single file, follow the documentation, and almost everything you need will already be installed and pre-configured.

# Donations

I haven't charging for this plugin. For me, it's a kind of hobby, and I like to contribute a few improvements and automations to help people with the same difficulties I had.

Anyway, if you feel grateful and would like to make a donation, please use the button below, it will help me to improve this plugin!
