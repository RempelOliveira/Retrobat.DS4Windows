# Retrobat.DS4Windows

This is a 3rd-party implementation designed to help you use [DS4Windows](https://ds4-windows.com) with [Retrobat's](https://www.retrobat.org) retro games interface.

With this package, you won't need to install DS4Windows to emulate Xbox 360 joysticks or make complex configurations for different games of Windows. Just run a single file, follow the documentation, and almost everything you need will already be installed and pre-configured.

# Running

This package install DS4Windows as a portable software with all joystick configurations you need. But, it's very important to remeber to install the HidHide software after runs the Install.bat file.

The installer will install the NirCmd software as well that is necessary for controll of windows of the system.

After the complete installation, you'll need to create a Retrobat shortcut with a customized command and then you can use .bat files to start your Windows games.
